\subsection{Optimal control without feedback}
When controlling the helicopter with only the estimated optimal input sequence, the linearization and modeling errors becomes to large, and the helicopters behavior will deviate drastically from the estimated response.

\subsection{Optimal control with feedback}
While the open-loop configuration of optimal control was quite poor, the closed-loop configuration with a LQR was quite promising.

- Limit inputs
- Avoid areas

\subsection{MPC w/ implicit feedback}
