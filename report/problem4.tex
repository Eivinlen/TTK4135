\section{Optimal Control of Pitch, Travel and Elevation with and without Feedback}\label{sec:prob4}
In this section, we extend our model to include the remaining states; elevation $e$, and elevation
rate $\dot{e}$. We use a non-linear solver to compute an optimal trajectory in two dimensions,
and additionally constrain the elevation to avoid a restriction shaped as a bell-curve.

\subsection{State-space formulation}
The state-vector is extended with the remaining states,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:day4_cost}
    x = \begin{bmatrix} \lambda & r & p & \dot{p} & e & \dot{e} \end{bmatrix}^T
\end{equation}
and the elevation setpoint is added to the input-vector
\begin{equation}
    u = \begin{bmatrix} p_c & e_c \end{bmatrix}^T.
\end{equation}
The system is on the usual state-space form (\ref{eq:state_space_axbu}), with
\begin{equation}
    \dot{x} =
    \underbrace{
    \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 1 &      0     &      0     &      0     &      0    \\
    0 & 0 &    -K_2    &      0     &      0     &      0    \\
    0 & 0 &      0     &      1     &      0     &      0    \\
    0 & 0 & -K_1K_{pp} & -K_1K_{pd} &      0     &      0    \\
    0 & 0 &      0     &      0     &      0     &      1    \\
    0 & 0 &      0     &      0     & -K_3K_{ep} & -K_3K_{ed}
    \end{bmatrix}}_{A_c}
    x +
    \underbrace{
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0       &     0     \\
        0       &     0     \\
        0       &     0     \\
    K_1K_{pp}   &     0     \\
        0       &     0     \\
        0       & K_3K_{ep}
    \end{bmatrix}}_{B_c}
    u
    \label{eq:extended_state_space}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Discretization}
We discretize (\ref{eq:extended_state_space}) using the same method as in section (\ref{sec:prob2}). That is, an approximation of the discrete-time state-space matrices is
\begin{equation}
    A \approx I + hA_c
    \qquad\text{and}\qquad
    B \approx hB_c
\end{equation}
where $I$ is the $6\times6$ identity matrix.

\subsection{Modelling the restriction}
A common application of optimal control is to implement restrictions, such as avoiding physical objects or as constraints in the optimization problem. Such restrictions can not be enforced when using only state feedback controllers. We wished to restrict the helicopter head to move above the bell-shaped curve
\begin{equation}
    e_k \geq \alpha \exp (-\beta (\lambda_k - \lambda_t)^2 )
\end{equation}
for all timesteps $k$ of the horizon. Since this is a non-linear constraint, we could no longer use a QP solver. Instead, a non-linear solver was needed, and in this case, the MATLAB function fmincon was used with a SQP-type algorithm.

\subsection{Objective function}
For this assignment, the cost function is the same as in equation (\ref{eq:trajectory_cost}), but with an extra term for penalizing elevation. We chose to set up the cost function on a more general form:
\begin{equation}
    \phi=\sum(x^{T}Qx+u^{T}Ru)
\end{equation}
Here, $Q$ and $R$ are diagonal matrices, with unity weight on $q_{travel}$, $r_{pitch}$ and $r_{elevation}$, so that it corresponds with the extended state and input vectors (\ref{eq:day4_cost}). This formulation makes it possible to easily put some weight on the other states as well, if deviation in these states should be penalized.

\subsection{Results}
For controlling the helicopter, we used a horizon of $N=60$ timesteps and step length of 25 milliseconds witch equals 15 seconds. This gave an optimal trajectory that looked much the same as for assignment 3 for pitch and travel. In addition, an elevator trajectory just touching the top of the bell curve constraint was also calculated. The suggested horizon of $N=40$ did not terminate in reasonable time, and was therefore replaced by a longer horizon giving reasonable results. The solution without feedback acted in the same manner as it did in section (\ref{sec:prob2}), as shown by figure (\ref{fig:day4_ol}). The real trajectory of travel and elevation tried to follow the optimal solution, but the effects linearization and having an imperfect model became more and more clear as time passed, and at the end of the horizon, the travel drifted away from the solution just like in section (\ref{sec:prob2}) since it did not manage to stop correctly.

    \label{fig:day4_ol}
\end{figure}

Using feedback and LQR, the helicopter managed to follow the calculated trajectory quite good after some tuning. As in section (\ref{sec:prob3}), it was appropriate to weight deviation(s) in travel (and here also elevation) more than deviation in pitch.
When working on a strongly linearized system, the system response is better when trying to follow the estimated state trajectory, rather than following the optimal input sequence. This input will, given the modelling errors, not lead to an appropriate response for the trajectories. The result, with different weights on the states of $Q_{LQR}$ can be seen in the following figures.

    \label{fig:day4_cl_plot_allQ}
\end{figure}

One thing worth noticing is that the trajectory of elevation consequently fell below the constraint at the peak of the constraint, after approximately 11 seconds. We believe this is due to the fact that our model suggests that there is no link between the model for elevation, and that of pitch. They are in fact linked, and because of this, the regulator doesn't manage to meet both demands perfectly at the same time, and we get a deviation. If the model would include these crossing terms, the result would probably be better. The problem with this approach is that it leads to a non linear objective function, which takes longer time to compute for the solver.
