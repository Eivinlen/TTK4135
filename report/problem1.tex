\section{Repetition/Introduction to Simulink/QuaRC}\label{sec:prob1}

This part is just a repetition, and therefore does not contain any important results. However, the part is important because it is used to test the hardware setup at the lab. This is done using a handed out model that made the helicopter hover at zero elevation and zero pitch. The helicopter suffered from minor drifting as a result of the motor being treated as equal, while they actually need to be tuned separately with one motor constant each. This was expected and did not introduce a problem since the drifting would be eliminated as soon as some form of feedback was implemented.
