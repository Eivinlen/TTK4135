%First re-read your paper/report for an overview. Then read each section and condense the information in each down to 1-2 sentences.
% - Next read these sentences again to ensure that they cover the major points in your paper.
% - Ensure you have written something for each of the key points outlined above for either the descriptive or informative abstract.
% - Check the word length and further reduce your words if necessary by cutting out unnecessary words or rewriting some of the sentences into a single, more succinct sentence.
% - Edit for flow and expression.

The purpose of the helicopter project in TTK4135 is to get experience combining optimization algorithms and control theory on a real world platform. The helicopter will be controlled using an optimal trajectory computed from a linearized model, both in open-loop and closed-loop with a linear quadratic regulator. The project also gives an introduction to hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) and automatic generation of code using MATLAB and QuaRC.

The main topics of this project are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Formulating and discretizing a state-space model for the helicopter
\item Optimal control with linear inequality constraints
\item Applying linear quadratic regulator (LQR) to the optimal trajectory
\item Optimal control in two dimensions with non-linear inequality constraints
\end{itemize}
