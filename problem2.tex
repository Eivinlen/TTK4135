\subsection{Computation of optimal trajectory}

An optimal trajectory can be generated by minimizing the cost function
\begin{equation}
	\phi = \sum_{i=1}^{N}(\lambda_i - \lambda_f)^2 + qp_{ci}^2
\end{equation}
for some scalar weight $q \geq 0$, while implementing the system dynamics and other user-defined limitations as linear constraints.

Note that this cost function does not take into consideration that $\lambda_i$ plus some multiple of $2\pi$ describes the same physical orientation of the helicopter. For example, if the reference is $0$ and $\lambda_i = 2\pi$, it will be regarded as a large error, even though the helicopter is infact in the desired orientation. A more optimal scheme would take this into consideration.
